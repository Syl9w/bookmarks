In this project I built authentication system in my site by using Django framework. 
Furthermore I implemented all necessary views for users:
- log in
- log out
- edit password
- reset password
- edit profile 
I built a model for custom user profiles and I created a custom authentication backend to let users log in to site using their email address. 
Also added social authentication to your site so that users can use their existing Facebook or Google account to log in.
